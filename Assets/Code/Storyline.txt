Storyline 1 (Icewind Dale Ripoff): It is the middle of winter, and food supplies are running low in your hometown.
    The cold has frozen the lake, preventing others from fishing. The traps are bare, and
    animals are scarce. The capital is sending a caravan of food, but it was scheduled to
    arrive days ago, and you have been sent out to find it.

    You found the wagons abandoned and looted. No horses are attached, and the crates have
    been removed. Luckily, the heavy snow left footprints for you to follow, and you tracked
    the culprits back to their cave. You enter the mouth of the cave, ready to reclaim the 
    food for your home.
