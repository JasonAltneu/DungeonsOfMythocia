Storyline 1 (Icewind Dale Ripoff): It is the middle of winter, and food supplies are running low in your hometown.
    The cold has frozen the lake, preventing others from fishing. The traps are bare, and
    animals are scarce. The capital is sending a caravan of food, but it was scheduled to
    arrive days ago, and you have been sent out to find it.

    You found the wagons abandoned and looted. No horses are attached, and the crates have
    been removed. Luckily, the heavy snow left footprints for you to follow, and you tracked
    the culprits back to their cave. You enter the mouth of the cave, ready to reclaim the 
    food for your home.

Storyline 2: The world is teetering on the brink. From the far North, an army of orcs is on the march, destroying
    every city in their path. You have weeks, maybe days before the orc army arrives at your small village. Local
    legends talk of a tomb where an ancient hero was buried, a hero who had defended your village once before. He
    was said to carry a magical amulet (chosen due to ambiguity for character class) that gave him the power to
    face an army.

    The location of this tomb is well known, and many have tried to claim this amulet, but none have returned. Out 
    of desperation, you have made the trek to the tomb and entered. The door closes behind you and locks. You must
    claim the amulet, or die in the process.
